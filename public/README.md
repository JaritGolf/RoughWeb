# Video Assets

This directory should contain the following video files for the hero section:

## Required Files

1. **hero-video.mp4** - Main video file (MP4 format)
   - Recommended resolution: 1920x1080 or higher
   - Recommended duration: 10-30 seconds
   - Should loop seamlessly

2. **hero-video.webm** - WebM version for better compression
   - Same content as MP4 but in WebM format
   - Provides better compression and faster loading

3. **placeholder-video-poster.jpg** - Poster image
   - Static image that shows while video loads
   - Recommended size: 1920x1080
   - Should represent the video content

## Video Guidelines

- **Content**: Should be relevant to your brand and "Find Your Feel" theme
- **Quality**: High quality, professional footage
- **Length**: 10-30 seconds for optimal performance
- **Loop**: Should loop seamlessly without jarring transitions
- **Audio**: No audio needed (video will be muted)
- **File Size**: Optimize for web delivery (under 10MB for MP4)

## Fallback

If video files are not available, the hero section will show a gradient background as a fallback.

## WordPress Integration

When converting to WordPress, these files can be managed through:
- WordPress Media Library
- Custom fields for video URLs
- Page builder video blocks
